A good testing process involves all stakeholders, is structured and facilitates an easy flow of the experiments from ideation to reporting. At Euroflorist I implemented an online tool to which everyone has access and involves them in the experiment process. It also provides a clear overview of all past research, learnings and reports making it an essential database of our customer knowledge.

Roughly the experiment process follows these stages:

Idea → Hypothesis → Complete test plan → Designing → Development → Q\\&A → Approval → Live → Analysis → Report.

See also slides 48–54 In my presentation on [building an optimization dream team](/presentation/building-your-optimization-dream-team).

Key metrics for experiments will mainly follow company wide KPIs and the micro conversions that lead to these main KPIs:

* **Immediate goal:** Does the user reach the “next step”?

* **Session goal:** Does the user end up using the product/ creating an account?

* **Lifetime goal:** Does the user return X times to use the product (at least until the “aha” moment). How many new users start using the product through this user?

Important elements for a good optimization culture are:

* A broad data literacy

* Leadership & trust

* An inquisitive, questioning culture

* Iterative, learning culture

* Bottom-up

* Share learnings widely

* Clear north star goal

For more on culture, see my presentation on [Optimization Culture](/presentation/creating-an-optimization-culture).

In the end success will be determined in how much we contribute to the main goal(s) of the company.

Ideas on the above? Let me know in the comments!
