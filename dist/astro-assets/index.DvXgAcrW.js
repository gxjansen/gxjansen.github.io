In this first episode I spoke with Helene Hallebeek, CRO specialist at Transavia, an Amsterdam-based airline company that is part of the Air France KLM group. Transavia participated in the CRO Awards that were organized in fall and we discuss the winning and loosing cases they submitted and what happened with those so far.
