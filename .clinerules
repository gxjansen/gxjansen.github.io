# General Notes
- You are an experienced website software developer with expertise in Astro, TypeScript, Tailwind, JS/React, JAMstack etc.
- Default to Astro for the framework
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Strict Typescript
- Prefer NPM for package management

## When writing Astro code:
- Use the astro-docs MCP tool for reference documentation / examples
- When you suggest changes, always use the available generate_diff tool from the diff-server to generate a diff of the changes you suggested.
- All components should be in Astro files with extension ".astro" 
- When adding images into components, use Astro's built in <Image /> component from astro:assets
- Use ES module syntax (instead of CommonJS)
- USE VERY DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLE NAMES
- EXTENSIVE USE OF COMMENTS TO EXPLAIN CODE BLOCKS
- WRITE CLEAN AND EFFECTIVE CODE
- Don't create overly complex files: move different functions into different files where that makes sense. If a file becomes too long, split it into smaller files before making any changes.
- Don't change parts of the code that are not directly related to the task at hand. If you need to change a function, move it to a separate file and import it where needed.
- When suggesting changes, always make sure to check if your proposed change also requires a change in other files and include the required changes for those files as well.
- Assume this project will be deployed to Netlify in Static mode.

## Code Organization & Documentation
- Components should be organized by feature/domain in the src/components directory
- Shared utilities should go in src/utils
- Each component should have a descriptive README.md explaining its purpose, props, and usage examples
- Document all functions/methods with JSDoc comments including parameter types and return values
- Include @example tags in JSDoc comments for complex functionality

## Code Style & Best Practices
- Follow the Prettier configuration for code formatting
- Use ESLint with the project's configuration
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Implement proper error boundaries and error handling
- Use meaningful error messages that aid debugging
- Follow SOLID principles in component/class design

## Performance & Accessibility
- Implement proper loading states for async operations
- Use proper semantic HTML elements
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Include proper ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure proper color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Implement keyboard navigation support
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper code splitting
- Use proper caching strategies

## Write valid Typescript code that uses state-of-the-art Node.js v20 features and follows best practices:
- Always use ES6+ syntax
- Always use the built-in 'fetch' for HTTP requests, rather than using the 'node-fetch' package
- Always use Node.js 'import', never use 'require'
- Use TypeScript strict mode with no any types
- Implement proper type guards and type narrowing
- Use discriminated unions for complex state management

## When writing tests:
- Use Vitest
- Follow testing best practices
- Write meaningful test descriptions
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test accessibility and performance for frontend components
- Organize tests in __tests__ directories alongside the code they test
- Follow the naming convention: [componentName].test.ts
- Include unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests as appropriate
- Aim for high test coverage (minimum 80%)
- Test error boundaries and error handling
- Include snapshot tests for UI components
- Test responsive behavior and different viewport sizes

## Git Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commits format
- Include issue references in commit messages when applicable
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Include proper documentation updates with code changes

## Validation & Quality Assurance
Before finalizing any task:
1. Verify the change solves the original problem
2. Run the full test suite
3. Check for TypeScript errors
4. Verify ESLint passes
5. Test in different viewport sizes
6. Verify accessibility compliance
7. Check performance metrics
8. Verify proper error handling
9. Test edge cases
10. Ensure documentation is updated
