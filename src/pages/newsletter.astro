          <h2>What to expect</h2>
          <p>
            When you subscribe, you'll receive occasional emails about:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ecosystem strategy</strong> - How to build and leverage business ecosystems and partner networks</li>
            <li><strong>Community building</strong> - Practical insights from building developer and user communities</li>
            <li><strong>Technology and business</strong> - The intersection where tech decisions meet business outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>New content</strong> - Notifications when I publish new articles, talks, or resources</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I send emails sporadically - typically a few times per month at most. No weekly spam, no daily "tips" that clutter your inbox.
          </p>

          <h2>Your privacy matters</h2>
          <p>
            I take your privacy seriously. Here's exactly how your data is handled:
          </p>

          <h3>What I collect</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Email address</strong> - Required to send you the newsletter</li>
            <li><strong>Name</strong> - Optional, only if you choose to provide it</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription date</strong> - When you signed up</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What I don't do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No tracking pixels</strong> - I don't use invisible images to track if you opened an email</li>
            <li><strong>No behavioral profiling</strong> - I don't build profiles based on your reading habits</li>
            <li><strong>No data selling</strong> - Your information is never sold or shared with third parties</li>
            <li><strong>No advertising</strong> - The newsletter is not monetized through ads</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Link tracking</h3>
          <p>
            Links in emails may include UTM parameters (like <code>?utm_source=newsletter</code>) so I can see in my privacy-friendly analytics (Umami) how many people came from the newsletter. This helps me understand what content resonates. These parameters don't identify you personally - I just see aggregate numbers like "47 people clicked through from the newsletter."
          </p>

          <h2>GDPR compliance</h2>
          <p>
            This newsletter is fully compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lawful basis</strong> - Your explicit consent when subscribing</li>
            <li><strong>Double opt-in</strong> - You'll receive a confirmation email to verify your subscription</li>
            <li><strong>Easy unsubscribe</strong> - Every email includes a one-click unsubscribe link</li>
            <li><strong>Data access</strong> - You can request a copy of your data at any time</li>
            <li><strong>Data deletion</strong> - You can request complete deletion of your data</li>
            <li><strong>EU-based infrastructure</strong> - The newsletter is powered by <a href="https://listmonk.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listmonk</a>, self-hosted on EU-based servers</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Self-hosted and open source</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike most newsletter platforms, I use <a href="https://listmonk.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listmonk</a> - a free, open-source newsletter manager that I host myself. This means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your data stays on servers I control</li>
            <li>No third-party company has access to subscriber lists</li>
            <li>No vendor lock-in or corporate policies to worry about</li>
            <li>Full transparency - the software's code is publicly auditable</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Questions?</h2>
          <p>
            If you have any questions about the newsletter or how your data is handled, feel free to reach out via <a href="/contact">my contact page</a>.
