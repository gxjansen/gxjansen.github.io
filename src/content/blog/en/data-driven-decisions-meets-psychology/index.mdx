#### After a short introduction, I spoke about these 3 topics:

1. [why psychology is important when selling online](https://medium.com/@gxjansen/data-driven-decisions-meets-psychology-8622194c9626#2b9b);

2. [how to build an optimization team](https://medium.com/@gxjansen/data-driven-decisions-meets-psychology-8622194c9626#d498);

3. [how to work on your optimization culture](https://medium.com/@gxjansen/data-driven-decisions-meets-psychology-8622194c9626#2c28).

I hope [my session](https://nomadmage.com/product/data-driven-decisions-meets-psychology/) inspired you to work on this, but I don’t have the illusion that my 1,5 hour general session gave you all the information you need for your specific situation. So to help you get started, below you will find many notes and further readings on the topics around this session t get you started on implementing this in your organization.
