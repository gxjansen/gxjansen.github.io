Because...

1. I like a challenge and learn new things

2. I like how fast static websites are

3. To get rid of the monthly CMS/Hosting fees but for this site, and hopefully in the near future also for the 4 CRO.CAFE podcast sites ðŸ¤ž

I decided to move my website from Webflow to [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Came across Astro some months ago and since then we also built the [CommerceQuest](https://commercequest.space/) website with it (alongside the Vanilla forum) and I really like it.

* It's a static website generator. In general, that has some benefits over more database driven websites, e.g.:

  * **Speed**: Faster loading and response times due to pre-built pages.

  * **Reliability**: More stable with fewer potential points of failure.

  * **Security**: Reduced vulnerabilities without databases or server-side processing.

  * **Hosting**: Easy to deploy and scale, handles high traffic well.

  * **Maintenance**: Simpler updates, typically just editing HTML or Mardkown files.

  * **Cost**: More economical to develop and host due to lower resource needs.

* Astro resizes and compresses images automatically based on what the page requires;

* Their islands concept makes so much sense (static by default, interactive where needed);

* Great documentation;

* Active community;

* Fully Git based, so good history and rollback options;

* I learn a ton, and - despite not being a developer - I like working with the code and figuring  out new technologies.

## Stack

I'm basing the new system on [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
