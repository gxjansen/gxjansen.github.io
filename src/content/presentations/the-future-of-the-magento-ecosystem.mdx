The Magento community is thriving and wants to push forward fast. This presentation is about feelings and ideas that live within the community and that I've discussed with many at Meet Magento conferences and on IM chats in the past months. I presented this at the Magento Snowcamp in Austria in January and this week at Meet Magento in Spain. Let me know what you think in the comments!
