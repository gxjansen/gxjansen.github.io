In this presentation and workshop I discuss recent industry reports, share fresh CRO research and guide you through the setup of the optimization process and how to grow it based on your current company and team maturity levels. We discuss the optimal workflow, how to increase team knowledge, how to improve management buy-in and how to prioritize. We discuss how to improve your experimentation velocity, capacity and coverage, and how to set your KPIs. We do a workshop on hypothesis setting and will show you how you can estimate long-term ROI.
