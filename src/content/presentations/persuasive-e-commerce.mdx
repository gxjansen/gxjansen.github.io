Presentation or workshop in which I teach the audience about the biases that our brain has, the mistakes we make while making decisions and how we can utilize this in an e-commerce environment.

By far my most popular popular presentation. Started out giving this session in 2011 and it kept evolving over the years in a session I have now given in over 25 countries!
