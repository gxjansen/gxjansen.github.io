Many people want to go on stage and share their knowledge and experience, but many don't. In this open session I usually 'drag' another regular speaker on stage with me and start talking about how to give talks, how to prepare, the failures I had and mistakes I made. I talk about the impostor symptom and give a lot of practical tips for people who would like to some day present a session at a conference.

No slides are being used during this session.
