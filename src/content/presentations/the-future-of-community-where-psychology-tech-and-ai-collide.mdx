As communities continue to evolve, the intersection of psychology and technology is becoming increasingly critical.

I will explore the future trends that are set to redefine how consumers interact with online platforms. From AI-driven personalization to the psychological triggers that drive user engagement, we'll delve into what the future holds and how businesses can prepare for the seismic shifts on the horizon.

By the end of this session, attendees will have:
- a good understanding of latest trends that combine AI and Community building;
- a list of things they can implement and start experimenting with in their own community right away.
