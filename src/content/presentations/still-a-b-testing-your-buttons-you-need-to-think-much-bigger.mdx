- CRO/CXO, Experiments and A/B testing have gained a lot of traction in the last years, hopefully also within your company;
- When optimizing, a lot of commerce teams seem stuck experimenting with minor frontend changes like text, images or layout.
- While still valuable to do this, you could benefit much more from the experimentation mindset when applying this to not just your frontend, but to across all aspects of your business
- Guido shows you how using Packaged Business Capabilities can give your commerce team the freedom to do just that.
