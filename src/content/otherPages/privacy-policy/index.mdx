_Last updated on November 20, 2025_

This privacy policy explains how I, Guido X Jansen, handle your personal information when you visit my personal website at gui.do.

**Note:** This is a personal website, not a commercial business. This policy has been prepared to be transparent about data practices and comply with applicable privacy laws.

## Information I Collect

### Information You Provide

This is a personal informational website. I do not collect personal information through forms or user accounts. However, if you contact me directly via email at x@gui.do, I may process:

- Your name
- Email address
- Message content
- Any information you voluntarily provide

This communication is processed based on my legitimate interest in responding to inquiries and is stored in my personal email system.

### Automatically Collected Information

This is a static personal website with no analytics or tracking. I do not actively collect any information about your visits.

However, as with any website, my hosting provider (Netlify) may collect basic technical information in their server logs:

- IP address
- Date and time of access
- Pages requested
- HTTP response codes
- Browser user agent

This information is collected and retained by Netlify according to their privacy policy and is not accessible to me for analytics purposes.

### Information I Do NOT Collect

To be clear about what I don't collect:

- I do not collect financial or payment information
- I do not create user accounts or detailed user profiles
- I do not collect sensitive personal data (health, biometric, racial/ethnic origin, political opinions, etc.)
- I do not track users across other websites beyond this domain
- I do not collect information from children

## How I Use Your Information

The minimal information I process is used only for:

- To operate and maintain this personal website
- To respond to your inquiries when you contact me via email
- To comply with legal obligations if applicable

I do not use your information for marketing, profiling, or any other purposes beyond what is stated above.

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), my legal basis for processing personal information is:

- **Legitimate Interest**: I respond to your inquiries when you contact me directly, based on my legitimate interest in communication
- **Legal Obligation**: I may process data to comply with applicable laws and regulations if required

Since this site does not track users or collect data beyond direct email contact, no consent is required for cookies or analytics.

You have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interest at any time.

## Analytics and Tracking

**I do not use any analytics or tracking on this website.** This is a privacy-first static personal website with no user tracking, cookies for analytics, or behavioral monitoring.

Your browsing activity on this website is not tracked, analyzed, or shared with any third parties.

## Cookies

**I do not use cookies on this website.** As a static website built with Astro, this site does not set any first-party or third-party cookies.

Third-party embedded content (such as YouTube videos or Spotify podcast players) may set their own cookies when you interact with them, but these are controlled by those services and not by me.

I have no control over data collection by these embedded services. Please review their respective privacy policies.

### Podcast Feed Processing

I operate a serverless function that fetches and aggregates podcast episodes from Transistor.fm RSS feeds. This function:
- Does not collect user data
- Caches podcast metadata for performance (1 hour)
