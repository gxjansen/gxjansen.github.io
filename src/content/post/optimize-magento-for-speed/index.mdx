Less than two weeks ago I did a blogpost about '[101 ways to speed up your Magento e-commerce website](https://www.gui.do/post/101-ways-to-speed-up-your-magento-e-commerce-website/)' that made my blog stats skyrocket. This blogpost is a quick update about two things: more tips and a Magento site to prove to you Magento can be fast.

To begin with the first: thanks for all the great reactions to my list. I know I cheated a little with the title (I only started out with 30 tips), but with your help the list is now up to 43 tips and some additional bonus tips. That's great! Thank you guys for sharing and showing all those people complaining about Magento speed that there just plain wrong.

So again proof that Magento ís build for speed!&#x20;

Do you also run a Magento store or are you a Magento developer and have some additional tips I can add to [the list](https://www.gui.do/post//101-ways-to-speed-up-your-magento-e-commerce-website/)?

Please let me know in the comments so we can improve the list and use it as a reference document!
