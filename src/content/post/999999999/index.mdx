Today is a special day! First off, it's the 9th day of the 9th month of the year (20)09 aka 09/09/09. Taking time into account, it's getting even better at 09:09:09 in the morning (and also in the evening for those working with a 12-hour time format).\
\
Although this is pretty cool in itself (yes I'm a geek), it's getting even better for me personally: Today is the day I become 9.999 days old!\
\
So I'm 9.999 days old, on 09/09/09 on 09:09.\
\
That are 9 9's, how is that for a coincidence?
