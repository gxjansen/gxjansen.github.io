Dinner done. Dishes... later. The RTX 4080 is warmed up, ready to play. My game's weekly stamina supply will reset in 4 days. _Better not waste it._

<Admonition variant="prompt">$ qwen-mmorpg</Admonition>

Enter. Mana bar appears:

```plaintext
████████░░ 80%  ⏱ 4h 32m
```

Three quests in the backlog. I'll clear them all tonight and turn in for an early night.

I summoned the Almighty Qwen for the next quest: the _Guardian Gate_. Travelers can't pass through after resetting their soul-binding.

<Throbber word="Conjuring…" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  I found the corruption! The passage tokens weren't refreshing after the
  soul-bind reset. Cleared it. The Gate should open now.
</Admonition>

I check the Gate. Travelers pass through.

One command, dungeon cleared. The rush of making something happen quickly. PRODUCTIVITY BABY! 🚀

Next quest.

```plaintext
███████░░░ 70%  ⏱ 4h 08m
```

Nice, plenty mana left.

_The Throttling Shrine_. Too many dark spirits attempting to breach the Gate and I need to limit their assault.

<Throbber word="Weaving" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Done! After 5 failed attempts, intruders are frozen for 15 minutes. Added
  watchers for monitoring. Defense is complete!
</Admonition>

The shrine's runes look solid. I trigger the /verification ritual.

Failure.

I send Qwen the error glyphs.

<Throbber word="Deciphering" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Fixed! The Throttling Shrine ritual was using old bindings that didn't account
  for the new wards. Should pass now.
</Admonition>

I run the ritual again. Different failure.

<Throbber word="Enchanting" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Fixed! The Soul Chamber had a timing conflict my changes exposed.
</Admonition>

Wait—the Soul Chamber? I didn't touch the Soul Chamber.

<Throbber word="Reweaving" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Fixed! Resolved a binding issue in the Traveler Registry. Verification
  complete.
</Admonition>

Three failures. Two in places I never asked about. C'mon man, stop going to places I don't want you to go!

```plaintext
██████░░░░ 58%  ⏱ 3h 40m
```

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Apologies. Let me repair only the specific ritual failures.
</Admonition>

Verification finally passes.

Wait. Now the Guardian Gate is corrupted again? Travelers can't pass. Aaargh 🤦

```plaintext
█████░░░░░ 48%  ⏱ 3h 16m
```

Wut! Where the did all my Mana go?

---

Whack-a-mole time.

<Admonition variant="terminal">Fixed!</Admonition>

Ritual fails.

<Admonition variant="terminal">Resolved!</Admonition>

New corruption.

<Admonition variant="terminal">Complete!</Admonition>

No. No, it is not "complete" 😡

Wait. I recognize this pattern from psychology class: "Variable ratio reinforcement". Same as slot machines. Am I being played here?

One more command.

```plaintext

Mana doesn't carry over. Whatever I don't spend by weekly reset vanishes. I already paid for it.

So even when I should stop, there's this pull. Not using the allocation feels like leaving gold on the dungeon floor.

---

Two hours into a "twenty-minute quest". If I reset, I lose all context. I'd have to explain the dungeon again and watch Qwen make the same confident mistakes in a different order.

One more command.

<Throbber word="Channeling" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Completed thorough analysis. Ultrathink. Root cause was a circular binding
  between the Gate and the Soul Chamber. Refactored both systems. All rituals
  pass, verified the full pilgrim flow.
</Admonition>

I check everything. Gate works. Shrine works. Throttling works.

I check the change log. Four hundred runes modified across six chambers. I don't understand half of them. If this breaks tomorrow, I can't fix it without summoning Qwen again...

Works, though. 🤷

```plaintext
█░░░░░░░░░ 8%  ⏱ 1h 41m
```

Eight percent?!

Ok, finishing touches. I grab a small quest. Change the color of a waypoint marker (to orange of course).

<Throbber word="Transmuting" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">Done! Updated to specified hue.</Admonition>

Marker's correct. The entire navigation overlay is gone.

Noooooo.

I start typing the fix.

```plaintext
░░░░░░░░░░ 0%   ⏱ 1h 23m

SESSION MANA DEPLETED
Mana refills in 1h 23m
```

Mana depleted. The game locked me out.

I look at the clock. Shit, it's 1 am.

I was going to "play for an hour after dinner". The temple works but I can't explain how. I'm more dependent on my companion than I was three hours ago... And weirdly, I still feel like I accomplished something?

Time to sleep, I guess. 😴

---

Morning. Ceiling. Alarm. Not an 8-bit game sound. Back to reality.

My hand finds the laptop before my eyes open. The waypoint's still broken. Quick fix before my first meeting...?

Terminal opens. Fingers find the keys.

<Admonition variant="prompt">$ opencode</Admonition>

Enter. The RTX 4080 spins up. Token bar appears.

```plaintext
██████████ 100%  ⏱ 5h 00m
```

Weekly reset in 3 days. _Better not waste it._

<Throbber word="Conjuring" />
