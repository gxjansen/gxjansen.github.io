Gametime! Weekly stamina will reset in 4 days. _Better not waste it._

<Admonition variant="prompt">$ opus-mmorpg</Admonition>

Enter. Token bar appears.

```plaintext
████████░░ 80%  ⏱ 4h 32m
```

I summoned the Almighty Opus for the next quest: the _Guardian Gate_. Travelers can't pass through after resetting their soul-binding.

<Throbber word="Conjuring…" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  I found the corruption! The passage tokens weren't refreshing after the
  soul-bind reset. Cleared it. The Gate should open now.
</Admonition>

I check the Gate. Travelers pass through.

One command, dungeon cleared. I'd forgotten how satisfying this feels. PRODUCTIVITY BABY!

Next quest.

_The Throttling Shrine_. Too many dark spirits attempting to breach the Gate and I need to limit their assault.

<Throbber word="Weaving" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Done! After 5 failed attempts, intruders are frozen for 15 minutes. Added
  watchers for monitoring. Defense is complete!
</Admonition>

The shrine's runes look solid. I trigger the verification ritual.

Failure.

I send Opus the error glyphs.

<Throbber word="Deciphering" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Fixed! The ritual was using old bindings that didn't account for the new
  wards. Should pass now.
</Admonition>

Different failure. Different chamber entirely.

<Throbber word="Enchanting" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Fixed! There was a timing conflict my changes exposed. Verification complete.
</Admonition>

Three failures. Two in shrines I've never visited. C'mon dude...

Wait. The quest was the Throttling Shrine. I didn't ask about the Soul Chamber. I definitely didn't ask about whatever happened to the Traveler Registry.

I asked for wards but rebuilt the entire temple?!

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Apologies. Let me repair only the specific ritual failures.
</Admonition>

Verification passes.

The Guardian Gate is corrupted again. Travelers can't pass. Aaargh

```plaintext

Whack-a-mole time.

<Admonition variant="terminal">Fixed!</Admonition>

Ritual fails.

<Admonition variant="terminal">Resolved!</Admonition>

New corruption.

<Admonition variant="terminal">Complete!</Admonition>

No. No, it isn't.

Wait. I recognize this pattern from psychology class: "Variable ratio reinforcement". Same as slot machines. Am I being played here?

One more command.

Mana doesn't carry over. Whatever I don't spend by weekly reset vanishes. I already paid for it.

So even when I should stop, there's this pull. Not using the allocation feels like leaving gold on the dungeon floor.

---

Two hours into a "twenty-minute quest". If I reset, I lose all context. I'd have to explain the dungeon again and watch Opus make the same confident mistakes in a different order.

One more command.

<Throbber word="Channeling" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">
  Completed thorough analysis. Ultrathink. Root cause was a circular binding
  between the Gate and the Soul Chamber. Refactored both systems. All rituals
  pass, verified the full pilgrim flow.
</Admonition>

I check everything. Gate works. Shrine works. Throttling works.

I check the change log. Four hundred runes modified across six chambers. If this breaks tomorrow, I can't fix it without summoning Opus again...

Works, though.

```plaintext

Ok, finishing touches. I grab a small quest. Change the color of a waypoint marker (to orange of course).

<Throbber word="Transmuting" />

<Admonition variant="terminal">Done! Updated to specified hue.</Admonition>

Marker's correct. The entire navigation overlay is gone.

Noooooo.

I start typing the fix.

```plaintext
░░░░░░░░░░ 0%   ⏱ 1h 23m

SESSION MANA DEPLETED
Mana refills in 1h 23m
```

Mana depleted. The game locked me out.

I look at the clock. Shit, it's 1 am.

I was going to "play for an hour after dinner". The temple works but I couldn't explain how. I'm more dependent on my companion than I was three hours ago. And weirdly, I feel like I accomplished something.

Time to sleep, I guess. 😴

---

Morning. Ceiling. Alarm. Not an 8-bit game sound. Back to reality.

I reach for my laptop. Half-asleep. The waypoint's still broken. Quick fix before my first meeting.

Terminal opens. Fingers find the keys.

<Admonition variant="prompt">$ claude</Admonition>

Enter. Token bar appears.

```plaintext
██████████ 100%  ⏱ 5h 00m

Weekly reset in 3 days. _Better not waste it._
