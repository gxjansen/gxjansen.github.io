A hierarchy of evidence (or levels of evidence) is a heuristic used to rank the relative strength of results obtained from scientific research. I've created a version of this chart/pyramid applied to CRO which you can see below. It contains the options we have as optimizers and tools and methods we often use to gather data.

See Wikipedia for more explanation about [the scientific use of a hierarchy of evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_evidence).
