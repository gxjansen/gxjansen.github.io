I've yet to meet the first developer that is afraid they will lose their job because of AI 🤖

I don't think this sentiment stems from ignorance (or wishful thinking) but rather from the inherent adaptability ingrained in the mindset of successful developers.

## Evolution of (Web) Developers

Ever since Tim Berners-Lee created the first web server and graphical web browser in 1990 and we all started browsing with Mosaic and Netscape Navigator (yes I'm that old 👴🏼), developers have continually shaped the landscape of website creation.

And since then, the methods of website creation haven't remained stationary for even a year.

From HTML 1 to 5, CSS, PHP and JavaScript to the plethora of frameworks available today, web developers have navigated through a dynamic landscape of evolving browsers, screen sizes, and devices, catering to an expanding array of use cases and audiences, shaping the internet we currently inhabit.

## Beyond writing code

It might have begun with developers solely tasked with writing lines of code. Today, they are creative problem solvers, innovators, engineers and architects of digital solutions. Delving deep into the intricacies of technological challenges, seeking efficient and effective ways to tackle them.

How? By continuously adjusting, tinkering with new technologies and (re)training.

AI might be one of the bigger steps along the way, but web development has always been about taking steps into the unknown. Software development is synonymous with adaptability, evolution and the symbiotic relationship between human intellect and technology.

Even with AI, even as good as Devin, human insight is crucial for understanding challenges, testing solutions, and validating outcomes.

## Anticipating Changes

That is not to say nothing will change, or that the changes will be small. Some tasks or maybe even whole jobs might change. But that has been the same story ever since Mosaic.

Or as the old philosophers already said:

> The Only Constant in Life Is Change.

For developers, the integration of AI into their toolkit is simply another chapter in the ever-changing software landscape. It's like acquiring a new skill set or mastering a new programming language. Developers embrace the change, leveraging AI as a catalyst for innovation and creative problem-solving.

If there's any group that has been training to be ready for AI, it's software developers. 🚀

The rise of AI opens up a new era of possibilities. We're ready for it and it's a huge privilege to be a facilitator and to witness this transformation up close. 🙏
