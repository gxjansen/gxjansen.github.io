*Note: in December 2017, the website was moved to gui.do*

Although I've been blogging in English for quite some years now, today one year ago I switched my website from being local (guidojansen.nl since 2001) to global (gxjansen.com). It feels much more logical to have a .com instead of a .nl when you blog for an international audience right?

I had no idea up-front if this would indeed broaden my audience but when I look at my Google Analytics stats I think that the switch was a great success!

**Improved statistics**

Before this year 39% of my visitors came from outside of The Netherlands, but last year, this increased to 83%! And not only did the ratio change, also traffic in general increased by 470%! It's also great to see a larger percentage of returning visitors, lower bounce rates, more pages are being visited with every visit and doubled time-on-site.

For me enough reasons to believe it was a good choice to switch to a .com domain and to continue adding even more awesome blogposts! :)\


Some other stats for those who're interested:

Around 5% of my visitors uses a mobile device (and uses the mobile-optimized version of my website). Most popular browsers are Firefox (48%) and Chrome (28%), the most popular OS is Windows (65%) followed by Mac (21%).

**Biggest traffic sources:**

1. Google (organic)

2. Direct

3. Magento.com

4. RSS feeds

5. Twitter
