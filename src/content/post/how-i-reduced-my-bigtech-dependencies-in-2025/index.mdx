I hate being locked in to subscriptions, only to every year see the prices go up and the value go down. So in 2025 I've continued moving towards a more robust (or in some cases even antifragile) setup. And I don't want to sugarcoat this: it's taken me many evenings and weekends to get here and I'm not done yet. But hopefully in sharing my journey I can A) inspire you to make similar moves and B) make your journey a bit shorter and easier than mine.

## Why change?
- Subscriptions everywhere, vendor lock-in, limited mobility... I don't like these big companies force their changes on me.
- Privacy: While paying for these services (e.g. Gmail, LLMs, phones), I can't shake the feeling that it is still my data that is the real product being sold.
- I want my setup to be more privacy friendly.
- General annoyance with how many Big Tech companies are behaving.

## Why now?
I've been an open source user since I first came into contact with Mambo CMS in 2003, so nothing new in that sense. And unknowingly I made some decent antifragility choices (e.g. using my own e-mail domain). But over the years I've also accrued some sloppy/easy/bad choices and I found myself increasingly uncomfortable with being locked into too many places.

- More and better alternatives keep becoming available and easier to start using and customizing (especially with access to tools like Claude Code and a NAS or cheap VPS)
- Because increasingly, the vendors that have achieved some form of lock-in just do whatever like raising prices while simultaneously making the service worse (Check this rant by [Louis Rossmann on why paying for a service nowadays often gets you a worse experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4GZUCwVRLs)). Just being confronted with changes I didn't sign up for is not the experience I like to have.
- Europe (where I live) is leaning more into open source and technological sovereignty because it's more secure, cost‑effective, flexible, and innovative when done right. Several roadmaps and analyses point to open technologies as a lever for digital autonomy and sustainability in Europe (something which I fully support for all (united) countries, not just Europe).

## Preferences/Principles that keep the journey realistic
- **Open source first**, open standards second: I prefer tools where I can see the code (Astro, Firefox, Immich, Obsidian) and use non-proprietary formats (Markdown, CalDAV).
- **Data ownership**: I own my data or can export it completely. GDPR-respecting by default.
- **Pragmatic, not pure**: I'm not dogmatic about self-hosting everything. I use SaaS when lock-in is low (Netlify, OpenRouter) or I already have lifetime licenses (Plex). The goal is *mobility*, not ideology.
- **Incremental migration**: Run old and new systems in parallel. Switch when the new setup is "boringly reliable."
- **Identity independence**: Keep email/2FA/domains separate from apps. This makes future migrations dramatically easier.

## My starting points & current status
At the beginning of the year, I still had:
- Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Youtube Premium
- Google Workspace
- Audible
- Google Photos
- Websites running on Webflow

But I also already had:
- Synology NAS (DS920+ as main, DS418 as backup), Plex, public ingress; anything public runs on managed hosting (e.g Elestio or VPS) or SaaS.
- Signal for messaging
- Firewalla router that blocks a lot of ads/domains (at least when at home and/or using Tailscale)
- Bitwarden
- Obsidian
- Tailscale
- OpenRouter for the majority of LLMs. Not self hosted, but makes me extremely flexible in the LLMs I'm using.
- BlueSky (I haven't used Twitter or Instagram for over a year)

Things I've changed so far in 2025:
- Plex + \*arr stack to replace streaming services. Works great for English content, not great yet for 4/6 yo kids that want to watch things in Dutch
- Google Photos → Immich
- Authy → Aegis (+ YubiKey for hardware keys)
- Webflow → Astro (on Netlify)
- Moved more chatgroups from Whatsapp to Signal (only some parent groups still stuck on Whatsapp)
- Started building more automations and workflows between my (increasingly more open and self-controlled) apps with [n8n](https://www.n8n.io).
- Got a Fairphone 6 to replace my dying Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.
- Moved all e-mail domains, calendar, contacts to Fastmail. I first transitioned to Proton for my e-mail/calendar needs. And although the service itself is good, I mainly ran into issues when I wanted to automate things with my calendar. Proton's calendar has no CalDAV/CardDAV support (and this is also not on the roadmap) and that's what made me ultimately move on to Fastmail instead. (You can get [10% off your first year of Fastmail through this referral link](https://join.fastmail.com/dc7cc1ab).)

Transition targets underway:
- Google Workspace → Fastmail (The main thing left is to untangle Google SSO sign‑ins)
- Adobe CC → Affinity + Darktable/RawTherapee + DaVinci Resolve (this is mainly a habit thing I want to change)

You can start small by moving some smaller apps like some mentioned above.

If you want to seriously improve your antifragility, start the work with freeing your core identity and authentication:
- **Get your own e-mail domain.** I can't stress enough how important this one is. You need to own your own identity and a very important key to that is to have control over your e-mail as everything is connected to that. Even if you want to keep using gmail: use it with your own domain. If you ever want to get rid of Google (or whoever you are hosting your e-mail with) it is very hard to move away if you only ever used an @gmail.com address. I used Google Workspace for many years, using it with my own e-mail address allows me to switch e-mail providers from one day to another without losing any e-mails.
- **For any service/app signup: use e-mail, not SSO.** I get that it saves a couple of seconds, but it also locks you in. Especially annoying when the service you are using doesn't allow you to switch to another form of SSO or e-mail (looking at you Anthropic and Tailscale). So instead: signup for new services using your e-mail and maybe setup SSO as a secondary way to sign in if you really want. And of course always setup 2FA/MFA when available. Untangling all kinds of services from your SSO provider is NOT fun...
- **Open Authenticator**: speaking of 2FA/MFA: use an independent/open source app for this. You don't want your free Auth app to suddenly stop its service or start charging (or charging more). I moved from Authy to Aegis which means logging in to a service with Authy 2FA, disabling 2FA and enabling it again with Aegis. Annoying? Yes. Satisfying? Very. And as always: make exports/backups (which Aegis actually allows, Authy did not).

I left out a lot and I'm happy to dive into any specific area if there's interest, let me know in the comments!

## Terms Explainer

**Antifragile**: A concept by Nassim Taleb describing systems that actually benefit from shocks and volatility. In tech terms, it means your setup gets stronger when things change or break, not weaker. Think: having your own email domain means you can switch providers easily if one fails or raises prices.

**Open Source**: Software where the source code is publicly available for anyone to inspect, modify, and improve. Unlike proprietary software, you can see exactly what it does with your data.

**Open Standards**: File formats or protocols that anyone can use without restrictions (like Markdown, CalDAV, RSS). This prevents vendor lock-in since multiple tools can work with the same data.

**SSO (Single Sign-On)**: "Login with Google/Apple/Facebook" buttons. Convenient but creates dependency on that provider.

**2FA/MFA (Two-Factor/Multi-Factor Authentication)**: Extra security requiring a second verification (like a code from an app) beyond your password.

**NAS (Network Attached Storage)**: A dedicated device for storing files on your home network. Think of it as your personal cloud.

**VPS (Virtual Private Server)**: A rented server where you can host your own services and websites.

**CalDAV/CardDAV**: Open standards for syncing calendars and contacts across devices and apps.

**\*arr stack**: Collection of media automation tools (Sonarr, Radarr, etc.) that work with Plex for media management.
