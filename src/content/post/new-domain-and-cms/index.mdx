I managed to purchase the gui.do domain name (yes, very proud of this nerdy achievement) and switched the website to Grav CMS. I'm quite intrigued by the simplicity and flexibility of a flat file system, and I'm looking forward to see how it will work out.

This also means that after 13 year, I've moved away from hosting my website with Mambo/Joomla!
