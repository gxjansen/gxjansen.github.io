As announced in November I would be starting a new (Dutch) podcast series this year about CRO. Today the first episode launched!

In this first episode I spoke with Helene Hallebeek, CRO specialist at Transavia, an Amsterdam-based airline company that is part of the Air France KLM group. Transavia participated in the CRO Awards that were organized in fall and we discuss the winning and loosing cases they submitted and what happened with those so far.

Listen here: [CRO.CAFÉ - Conversie optimalisatie bij Transavia, met Helene Hallebeek](https://cro.cafe/nl/episodes/conversie-optimalisatie-bij-transavia-met-helene-hallebeek/)

Big shoutout towards [Effective Experiments](https://effectiveexperiments.com/) and [Convert.com](https://www.convert.com/) for being sponsors of CRO.CAFÉ right out of the gate!
