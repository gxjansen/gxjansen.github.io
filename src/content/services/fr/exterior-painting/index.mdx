**This would be french, except that I don't speak french and don't want to get something horribly wrong!** Content collections are subdivided into language folders like "src/content/blog/en" and "src/content/blog/fr".

Our paint company is a group of professionals. We don’t stand for cutting
corners. We don’t stand for sloppy work. We don’t stand for anything less
than the best.

Don't sweat the details, **we'll take care of it.**
