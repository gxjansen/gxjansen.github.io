/**
 * * These are larger cards with icons, titles, and text
 * Recommend using minimum 3 cards in a row, although this should work for any number of cards
 * These smaller cards work great if there are a large amount of services to advertise
 *
 * ! If you can an error for an icon like "Error: Not Found: "calendar-check" in pack "tabler",
 * ! You can copy to actual SVG into src/icons, name it whatever, and use similar to below example "tabler/calendar-check"
