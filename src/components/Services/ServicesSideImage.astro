I switched focus to e-commerce and between 2008 and 2021 focussed on one system in particular: Magento.  I organized the first worldwide Meet Magento event in 2009, organized 11 events in total and expanded the conference to over 550 yearly participants. This makes it one of the biggest Magento events worldwide and the start of a global movement of over 60 events.

In 2021 it was time to focus on something new and I became the Global Business & Technology Evangelist at the digital commerce visionairy Spryker.`,
