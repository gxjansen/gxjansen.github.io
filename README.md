# gui.do website

In this repo I'm building a new website for [gui.do](https://gui.do), replacing the current Webflow SaaS.

See [this article](https://gui.do/post/website-moved-to-astro/) with more background info on why I made the switch.

## Stack
I'm basing the new system on [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
