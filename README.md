# gui.do website

In this repo I'm building a new website for [gui.do](https://gui.do), replacing the current Webflow SaaS.

Because
A) I like a challenge and learn new things
B) I like how fast static websites are 
and
C) To get rid of the monthly Webflow fees

## Stack
I'm basing the new system on [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
