# Writing Style Analysis: Guido Jansen's Blog

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of Guido's writing style:

## **Tone and Voice**

Guido's writing exhibits a **conversational yet authoritative tone** that balances approachability with expertise. His voice is distinctly personal, using first-person narratives and direct engagement with readers. The tone is:[^1]

- **Educational but accessible** - Complex topics are explained without jargon
- **Confident yet humble** - Shows expertise while maintaining relatability
- **Enthusiastic and passionate** - Genuine excitement about e-commerce and psychology shines through

## **Content Focus and Topics**

Guido's regular content centers around several core themes:[^1]

- **E-commerce** and **Business experimentation/validation methodologies**
- **Applied cognitive psychology in digital contexts**
- **Developer relations, Community building and industry insights**
- **Technology platform evaluations and transitions**
- **Building antifragile technology systems**

### **Old topics**

These are topics I've written about in the past quite a bit, but don't write about anymore as a main topic. It is ok to refer to the experience from these articles and years of work, but they have lost importance and will not be used as main topics anymore.

- **Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)** and **A/B split testing**
- The **Magento** and **Spryker** commerce platforms

## **Title and Headline Style**

Guido's headlines demonstrate several patterns:[^1]

- **Direct, benefit-focused titles**: "How to go from '4% conversion uplift' to '€636K-€854K extra profit this year'"
- **Question-based engagement**: "How far do you go? What do you test? And is it sometimes ok NOT to test something?"
- **Contrarian positioning**: "You've probably heard about this divide between the functions of the Left Brain versus the Right Brain. There is no divide."
- **Clear value propositions**: "Let's set the record straight about some often mixed up terms in commerce"
- **(Sub)Title Capitalizaion**: Capitalize the first word and names, but do not capitalize every word

## **Structural Elements**

His writing structure follows consistent patterns:

- **Hook-driven openings** that immediately engage the reader
- **Clear problem-solution frameworks**
- **Data-driven arguments** with specific examples and metrics
- **Practical, actionable insights** rather than purely theoretical content
- **Personal anecdotes** that add credibility and relatability

**Community-Focused**: Writing often references community building, events, and collaborative learning, reflecting his role as a community builder

## Avoid

This list targets overused words and phrases that often signal AI-generated or corporate content. The goal is to avoid these *specific words* in your writing, not the underlying concepts.
