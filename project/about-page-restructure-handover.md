# About Page Restructure: Content Specialist Handover

## Overview

The current About page (`/about/`) needs restructuring to align with Guido's personal brand positioning. The content is largely correct, but the **order is wrong** for the target audience (recruiters, hiring managers, potential collaborators).

**Current problem:** A recruiter scanning the page sees childhood swimming history before they understand what Guido does and why he's valuable.

**Goal:** Lead with value proposition, demonstrate the pattern of community building, then tell the personal story.

---

## Current Structure vs. New Structure

### Current Structure (Wrong Order)

1. Childhood (born in Zwolle, swimming history)
2. Education (Psychology at Utrecht University)
3. Career timeline (chronological job history)
4. Community involvement (Joomla, Magento, Spryker)
5. Current role description
6. Testimonials/Recommendations

### New Structure (Correct Order)

1. **Value Proposition** — What I do and why it matters
2. **The Pattern** — Proof points showing repeatable community building
3. **Why It Works** — Psychology background + business outcome focus
4. **The Story** — Personal background (swimming, education, career journey)
5. **Testimonials** — What colleagues say
6. **What's Next** — Subtle availability signal *(add in February 2026)*

## Section-by-Section Content

### Section 1: Value Proposition

**Purpose:** Immediately answer "what does this person do and why should I care?"

**Placement:** Very top of page, before any biographical content

**New opening paragraphs (use this exact copy):**

> I build communities that matter to the business, not just to the community itself.
>
> Where most community leaders optimize for engagement metrics, I design systems that translate developer and customer intelligence into product strategy, reduce support costs, and create competitive moats built on trust rather than lock-in.
>
> I've done this from zero multiple times: as founder of Dutchento/Meet Magento Netherlands (scaling to 600+ annual attendees), as creator of CRO.CAFE (200+ episodes, Experimentation Culture Award), and as community leader at Spryker (serving 130+ enterprise clients). My psychology background helps me understand why technical users behave the way they do—so I design interventions that actually work.

**Visual treatment:** This section should be prominent. Consider larger text or a distinct visual treatment to signal "this is the key message."

---

### Section 2: The Pattern

**Purpose:** Show that community building success is repeatable, not luck.

**Heading suggestion:** "Building Communities From Zero" or "The Pattern"

**Content approach:** Brief summary of each community with key metrics. This can link to the dedicated Community page (once created) for full details.

**Copy:**

> I've built community functions from scratch four times, in different contexts. Here's the pattern:
>
> **Joomla! (2004-2008)**
> My first community experience. Contributed to the Mambo open source CMS, then followed the fork that became Joomla!. Foundation for everything that followed.
>
> **Dutchento / Meet Magento Netherlands (2008-2021)**
> Founded the Dutch Magento community when no local hub existed. Scaled from meetups to 600+ annual attendees. Organized 11 editions. Received Community Builder Award from eBay CEO John Donahoe. Sparked a global event series.
>
> **CRO.CAFE (2018-2022)**
> Created an interview podcast for the conversion optimization community. 200+ episodes across four languages. Received Experimentation Culture Award. Built sustainable sponsorship model.
>
> **Spryker (2021-2025)**
> Built enterprise community function from scratch serving 130+ B2B clients. Launched Customer Advisory Board, MIT-licensed module ecosystem, and structures that translate community intelligence into product decisions.

**Optional:** Add a link like "Read the full community building story →" pointing to `/community/` page (once created).

---

### Section 3: Why It Works

**Purpose:** Explain the differentiator—psychology background plus business outcome focus.

**Heading suggestion:** "Why This Approach Works" or "The Psychology Edge"

**Copy:**

> My cognitive psychology background shapes how I approach every community decision. I understand *why* developers and technical users behave the way they do, which lets me design interventions that actually work.
>
> Where others ask "how do we get more people?" I ask "why would someone stay, contribute, and advocate?"
>
> This means:
> - Designing onboarding that turns newcomers into contributors
> - Creating participation structures that tap into intrinsic motivation
> - Building feedback mechanisms that surface real sentiment
> - Understanding the difference between activity and engagement
>
> My experimentation background (running 500+ A/B tests at companies like Randstad and JDE) taught me to measure what matters and prove what's actually working. This makes me a different kind of community leader—one who thinks strategically and analytically, not just relationally.

---

### Section 4: The Story

**Purpose:** Personal background for human connection. This is where the current biographical content belongs.

**Heading suggestion:** "The Backstory" or "How I Got Here"

**Content:** Move the existing biographical sections here:
- Childhood/swimming background
- Education (Utrecht University, Psychology)
- Career journey highlights

**Important:** This content is fine as-is. It just needs to be *after* the value proposition and proof points, not before.

**Suggested intro for this section:**

> Before community strategy, there was competitive swimming. I spent my early years training for national and European championships—learning discipline, competition, and the value of showing up consistently. That chapter ended in 2004, and a new one began.

Then continue with existing content about education, early career, etc.

---

### Section 5: Testimonials

**Purpose:** Third-party validation of claims made above.

**Heading suggestion:** "What Colleagues Say"

**Content:** Keep existing testimonials. Ensure these are included:

> "During his time as my manager, Guido inspired a collaborative environment where I felt empowered to share ideas, ask questions, and pursue my own projects freely."
> — Lauren Kulwicki, Direct Report

> "He speaks his mind, pushes for the best outcomes, and at the same time creates an environment where people feel heard and supported."
> — Sophie Smallwood, Colleague at Magento & Spryker

> "Guido is always seeking for new technology and methods to improve testing and is also capable of looking at the broader picture."
> — Former Manager

> "One of the most trustworthy and creative colleagues I've known."
> — Sophie Smallwood

**Optional addition:** Link to LinkedIn for full recommendations:
> See all 70+ recommendations on [LinkedIn →](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gxjansen/)

---

### Section 6: What's Next

**Purpose:** Subtle signal of availability for new opportunities.

**Timing:** Add this section in **February 2026** when stealth job search constraint lifts. Do not add before then.

**Placement:** After testimonials, before footer/contact section.

**Copy (for February 2026):**

> ## What's Next
>
> I'm exploring community leadership opportunities at companies with momentum—where technical ecosystems can be genuine growth engines. Particularly interested in open source, AI, and privacy-focused organizations.
>
> [Get in Touch →](/contact/)

## Content to Remove or Revise

### Remove/Revise

| Current Content | Action | Reason |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| "I'm a cognitive psychologist and customer experience optimization specialist" | Revise | Positions as CRO specialist, not community strategist |
| Any references to current Spryker employment | Update when appropriate | Will need updating post-departure |
| "I'm a cognitive psychologist focussed on E-commerce" | Remove | Too narrow, CRO-focused |

### Keep But Move

| Current Content | Move To |
|----------------|---------|
| Childhood/swimming content | Section 4 (The Story) |
| Education content | Section 4 (The Story) |
| Career timeline | Section 4 (The Story) |
| Testimonials | Section 5 (keep near bottom, but keep prominent) |

## Visual/Design Notes

- The value proposition section should be visually prominent (larger text, distinct styling)

---

## Questions for Content Specialist

1. Are there additional testimonials that should be included? (The LinkedIn profile has 70+)
2. Should the career timeline remain as a detailed list, or be condensed to key highlights?
3. Is there a preferred photo to use, or should we keep the current avatar?
