# Developer Brief: Community Page

## Purpose

This page showcases Guido's track record of building communities from zero—multiple times, in different contexts. It's the main proof point for his "Community Strategist" positioning and should demonstrate a repeatable pattern, not one lucky outcome.

---

## Page Structure

### Hero Section

- **Headline:** Building Communities From Zero
- **Subhead:** I've built community functions from scratch four times across different contexts. Here's the pattern.
- **Optional:** Simple timeline graphic showing 2004 → 2008 → 2018 → 2021 with the four community names

### Four Community Cards/Sections

Display chronologically (oldest first) to show the progression and pattern. Each section should have:

- Community name + logo (if available/appropriate)
- Time period
- Role indicator (volunteer/creator/employee)
- Brief description (3-4 sentences)
- Key achievements (2-3 bullet points max)
- Optional: 1 image from the community/events

## Content for Each Section

### 1. Mambo/Joomla! (2004-2008)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Volunteer contributor |
| **Context** | Open source CMS community |

#### Description

My first community experience. I contributed to the Mambo open source CMS project, then followed the community fork that became Joomla! in 2005. This was my introduction to how open source communities work—the governance challenges, the passion, and how volunteer communities can build software that competes with commercial products.

#### Key achievements

- Early contributor to what became one of the world's most popular CMS platforms
- Learned open source community dynamics firsthand
- Foundation for all community work that followed

### 2. Dutchento / Meet Magento Netherlands (2008-2021)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Founder (volunteer) |
| **Time period** | 13 years |

#### Description

I founded the Dutch community for the Magento e-commerce platform when there was no local hub for developers and merchants. What started as local meetups grew into Meet Magento Netherlands—an annual event scaling to 600+ attendees that sparked a global event series in other countries.

#### Key achievements

- Scaled from local meetups to 600+ annual attendees
- Organized 11 editions of Meet Magento Netherlands
- Received Community Builder Award from eBay CEO John Donahoe
- Created a model replicated by Meet Magento events worldwide
- Community continued thriving after I reduced involvement

#### Quote (optional)

> "Starting local and in Dutch was key. I built a core audience that appreciated having a local space. This created a foundation that could then expand to international participation."

### 3. CRO.CAFE (2018-2022)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Creator & Host |
| **Time period** | 4 years |

#### Description

I noticed the conversion optimization community lacked a consistent interview-format podcast where practitioners shared how they actually worked. I created CRO.CAFE as a side project—1-on-1 conversations with people from agencies, brands, and tool vendors about their real work. The show attracted sponsorship and spun off into Dutch, Spanish, and German versions hosted by other specialists.

#### Key achievements

- Produced 200+ episodes
- Received Experimentation Culture Award for community impact
- Expanded to four languages with other hosts
- Built sustainable sponsorship model
- Created multi-language network reaching global CRO community

### 4. Spryker (2021-2025)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Employee (Senior Director, Global Business & Technology Evangelist) |
| **Time period** | 4+ years |

#### Description

Built the enterprise community function from scratch, serving 130+ B2B clients and their developer ecosystem. This was community building in a different context—enterprise software with no freemium tier, where community size is tied to sales rather than organic growth. Required different strategies: Customer Advisory Boards, MIT-licensed module ecosystems, and structures that translate community intelligence into product decisions.

#### Key achievements

- Built community platform serving 130+ enterprise accounts with 3-person team
- Launched Customer Advisory Board connecting enterprise clients directly to product teams
- Established MIT-licensed module ecosystem—creating a vendor-independent innovation layer
- Community-driven initiatives now influence 25% of product roadmap decisions
- Multiple hackathon projects adopted into core product

#### Quote (optional)

> "Unlike consumer communities where you can grow through free trials, enterprise B2B community requires different strategies. I learned to create value for a smaller, higher-stakes audience."

## Design Notes

### Visual hierarchy

- Lead with the pattern/story, not just a list
- Each community section should be scannable (headline, timeframe, 2-3 bullets)
- But also expandable or linkable for someone who wants the full story

### Suggested layout options

1. Vertical timeline with alternating left/right cards
2. Four equal cards in a grid (2x2 on desktop)
3. Single-column with each community as a distinct section

### Colors/styling

- Consider subtle visual distinction between "volunteer" (Mambo, Dutchento) and "professional" (CRO.CAFE, Spryker) communities
- Or: chronological gradient showing progression

### Mobile considerations

- Cards should stack vertically
- Key achievements should remain visible (not hidden in accordions)

## CTA at Bottom

**Headline:** What's Next

**Text:**

> I'm looking for my next community leadership challenge—ideally at a company with momentum, where technical ecosystems can be genuine growth engines. Particularly interested in open source, AI, and privacy-focused organizations.

**Button:** "Get in Touch" → links to contact page or email
