I was fortunate to work closely with Guido during our time at Spryker, where he led Community while I headed Learning Experience. From day one, it was clear that Guido doesn’t just build communities - he architects ecosystems that thrive under change and constant evolution while never losing sight of the individual people at the center of it all. Genuine human connection matters to Guido so he ensures that his team is creating spaces that are not only resilient but also deeply meaningful for the people within them.  
  
Exactly what happened with the developers community at Spryker. Through the events and hackathons Guido and his team created vibrant spaces where developers could not only collaborate and fuel the product with innovation but also feel part of something bigger than themselves.  
  
I saw first-hand how the initiatives of his team not only strengthened customer and partner engagement but also directly shaped product direction and organizational growth. Guido has a rare ability to translate community insights into tangible business intelligence and vice versa bring business closer to the community.  
  
Coming from learning, where it’s not always easy to show business impact, I’ve been impressed by how Guido consistently makes the impact of community on business tangible - a skill worth learning from him.  
What I always admired is how he combines deep strategic thinking with a very human, trust-based approach. He pushes for excellence, questions assumptions, and always brings fresh, innovative ideas to the table. At the same time, he creates an environment where people feel heard, supported, and empowered to contribute - a balance that’s not easy to achieve.  
  
If you’re looking for someone who can build antifragile communities, influence strategy at the highest levels, and inspire people around him, Guido is that person. It was a privilege working alongside him, and I’m excited to see the impact he continues to make in the community space.

I’ve greatly appreciated Guido’s role as Global Business & Technology Evangelist and community leader.  
  
Even though we didn’t collaborate on formal projects, our touchpoints at the intersection of the partner ecosystem and the community were always valuable. Guido consistently brought energy and openness, making it easy to connect on both professional topics and personal interests like AI and podcasting.  
  
What stood out was his habit of diving early into new topics like AI and actively guiding the community through change. He also excelled at connecting people across business and technology, turning community exchanges into actionable collaboration.  
  
Guido showed real leadership without ever being my manager, creating alignment and momentum simply by bringing people together.

I worked with Guido as CCO at Spryker and watched him build our developer community from scratch. He delivered results that mattered: developer feedback shaped our product roadmap, engineering teams connected directly with external developers, and our community became stronger after each challenge.  
Guido restarted our community meetups, launched developer hackathons, and created our Customer Advisory Board. What set him apart is that he made smart, pragmatic decisions. When Slack became unsustainable, he migrated us to Vanilla forums, giving our enterprise developers a searchable knowledge base while cutting support costs.  
His strategic thinking impressed me. Guido understood that communities need sustainable business value, not just engagement metrics. The hackathon projects directly influenced what we built next, including some AI features.  
If you're serious about developer relations or community-driven growth, hire him. You'll get someone who combines vision with execution, builds systems that last, and delivers a more connected ecosystem.

I’ve had the privilege of working with Guido at both Magento and Spryker. He is one of the most trustworthy and creative colleagues I’ve known. Guido brings a rare mix of energy, positivity, and technical acumen. He rolls up his sleeves to get things done, while also experimenting with new ideas and approaches.  
  
What stands out most is his ability to balance strong opinions with genuine psychological safety. He speaks his mind, pushes for the best outcomes, and at the same time creates an environment where people feel heard and supported. He’s a natural community builder, always bringing fresh ideas on how to connect, grow, and drive impact.  
  
Guido combines technical know-how with exceptional soft skills, making him both a strategic thinker and a hands-on collaborator. I’ve truly enjoyed working alongside him and always walk away inspired by his creativity and commitment.

Guido hired me to join his Community Team at Spryker and from the very first moment, he welcomed me with his enthusiasm and passion for e-commerce, community, and the Spryker product. During his time as my manager, Guido inspired a collaborative environment where I felt empowered to share ideas, ask questions, and pursue my own projects freely. I really appreciated Guido's efforts to consistently align our own team initiatives with wider company goals and actively involve the team in the decision-making process - he kept us on track with the bigger picture in mind, and we accomplished so much together! His solution-driven mindset and calming yet upbeat personality is really such an asset in the community field in particular, where experimentation, quick decisions, and pivots are a necessary part of the role. With the introduction of our new community platform and expanding our event scope, and we needed a leader who is quick to action and always keeping our community priorities on track. Guido is just this! He really embodies the spirit of community within Spryker, always leading with his authentic self and nurturing strong relationships both internally and externally. Guido, thank you for your care and attention during our time working together, I will always appreciate it and our special team!

Guido is one of those people that after talking to him you walk away having learnt something new or heard a new story but either way you walk away with a smile on your face.  
  
During my time supporting Guido and the community team, he provided a very high level of leadership and genuine care for both team members and the wider community. Guido has the ability to inspire and motivate, creating an environment where everyone feels heard and empowered to contribute. He is very easy to approach and happy to give you his time when needed to help support you.  
  
My favourite thing though is Guido's solution driven mind, he’s full speed ahead in his pursuit of progress, leveraging available tools and resources and exploring ideas deeply to ensure the best outcome. Our countless chats about technology showcased Guido’s passion for understanding every detail and finding the right path forward.  
  
I highly recommend Guido for any company or role. He is a true asset wherever he goes, capable of bringing value in countless ways and setting a high bar for what it means to be an outstanding colleague and leader.

I have known Guido for well over 15 years, from the early days of the Magento community, where he was already a central and inspiring figure, to our time together at Spryker. Even back then, I admired his ability to connect with people, create an impact, and combine his background in psychology with deep e-commerce expertise.  
  
At Spryker, Guido became one of the key figures driving our community's success. Through hackathons, user groups, and the CommerceQuest platform, he built not just activities but a genuine sense of belonging and motivation for developers — a critical factor in the success of any technology platform. I experienced this firsthand at hackathons, where his events not only highlighted Spryker's architectural strengths but also created an atmosphere of energy, fun, and inspiration.  
  
Guido's strengths go far beyond community building: he is a brilliant presenter, a natural connector, and a trusted advisor who understands both the human and business dimensions of digital commerce. His empathy, humor, and communication skills make him uniquely effective at engaging with people on every level, from developers to executives.  
  
For me, Guido is one of Spryker's unsung heroes: he strengthened the ecosystem, gave developers the trust and resources they needed, and created gravitational pull for our entire platform. Any company that has Guido will gain not only a world-class evangelist and strategist but also an inspiring and deeply empathetic leader.

## Mark 
Guido and I have worked closely together for 4 years at this point and he is one of the most inspirational people I have worked with. He can put his hand to many things - Community building obviously, but he has technical skills that helps him build incredible connection with the developer community.  
  
He understands every aspect of business and how he can help support other areas of the business through community, experimentation, just plain figuring stuff out. His psychology background has also helped him understand people and he always works with empathy and superb Emotional Intelligence.  
  
He can boost people up, support their needs - both from a human and a business perspective. He can lead from the front, and he can let others lead. He will always give credit to his colleagues and team.  
  
Personally, Guido and I have many great conversations on a breadth of subjects, most recently AI and automation. He is a fantastic sprring partner

## Christian
If you are looking for a Community Builder and Developer Relations Leader, you have found him. Guido and I worked together for four years as leadership peers when he shaped the community team at Spryker, while I was responsible for the delivery excellence of our SI and agency partners. Our fields overlapped a lot, and I am grateful for his impactful work.  
  
Guido's approachable, trustworthy personality makes him someone people naturally gravitate towards. In every interaction, whether on stage captivating an audience or in candid personal conversations, he remains humble, relatable, and intent on understanding others’ perspectives.  
  
He is convincing not only as an individual but also as a manager. Guido established a team of community evangelists that helped build relationships with our technical audiences. His leadership approach is based on trust and autonomy, much like mine. Guido's background in psychology clearly guides how he empowers his team and builds rapport with partners and customers.  
  
Guido enthusiastically embraces new technology, and his passion for learning is contagious. I'm amazed at how quickly he adopts new technologies. For example, he rapidly mastered cutting-edge topics like Agentic Development, Vibe Coding, and workflow automation. Bringing this to Spryker resulted in higher efficiency and quicker improvements, lowering our TCO.  
  
If you're seeking someone with a rich blend of technical expertise, interpersonal skill, and an unwavering commitment to building strong, vibrant communities, Guido is a standout leader I recommend wholeheartedly.
