 * The `persistedExchange` adds support for (Automatic) Persisted Queries

 * following it.
 *
 * It does so by adding the `persistedQuery` extensions field to GraphQL
 * requests and handles `PersistedQueryNotFound` and
 * `PersistedQueryNotSupported` errors.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Client, cacheExchange, fetchExchange } from '@urql/core';
 * import { persistedExchange } from '@urql/exchange-persisted';
 *
 * const client = new Client({
 *   url: 'URL',
 *   exchanges: [
 *     cacheExchange,
 *     persistedExchange({
 *       preferGetForPersistedQueries: true,
 *     }),

 *   ],
