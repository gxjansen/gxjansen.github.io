.# Welcome to Atlas!

1. To get started, first install all necessary packages with `npm install`, then run an initial build to make sure the setup works `npm run build`.
2. Next, you'll want to configure your site i18n setup (one language, or multiple). Follow instructions in the [i18n documentation](https://cosmicthemes.com/i18n/).
3. Now you can setup the site to your liking!

## Code Intro

I have created a few code tours to help introduce you to the codebase. You will need the extension [Code Tour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) to view them in VSCode.

## Code Structure

The source files have the following setup. Note that not all files are included - it is already long, no one wants it to be longer.

For robots like Google to see the correct sitemap, you will want to edit the `public/robots.txt` file to use your website domain.

## General Astro Info

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory. I also frequently use `src/assets` for images when using Astro asssets for image optimization.

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
